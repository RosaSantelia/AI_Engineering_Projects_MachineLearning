# üß† RealEstateAI Solutions: A Predictive Model for the Housing Market

**RealEstateAI Solutions** aims to optimize real estate price assessment by applying advanced **regularization techniques** within linear regression models. The goal is to provide **more accurate and reliable price predictions**, reducing overfitting and improving the model‚Äôs ability to generalize to unseen data.

In the real estate sector, precise property price estimates are crucial for informed decision-making. However, traditional linear regression models often suffer from **overfitting**, which undermines predictive accuracy. Therefore, it is necessary to explore **effective regularization methods** to improve predictive performance while managing model complexity.

By implementing and comparing regularized models like **Lasso**, **Ridge**, and **Elastic Net**, RealEstateAI Solutions provides a system capable of delivering **more stable and precise housing price predictions**. This enables real estate agents and investors to make data-driven decisions and gain a competitive edge in the market.

## üìå Project Requirements

### üõ†Ô∏è Dataset Preparation
- Load and preprocess housing price data.
- Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize/scale the data.

### üß™ Regression Model Implementation
- **Ridge Regression**: Train a model with L2 regularization.
- **Lasso Regression**: Train a model with L1 regularization.
- **Elastic Net Regression**: Train a model with a combination of L1 and L2 regularization.

### üìä Performance Evaluation
- Apply **cross-validation** techniques.
- Calculate **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** for each model.
- Compare model complexity by evaluating the number of non-zero coefficients.
- Analyze and compare the results of the different regularization approaches.

### üìà Results Visualization
- Generate plots to visualize and compare model performance.
- Plot residuals to assess model fit.

The project includes **fully commented source code**, with clear explanations of each step, design choice, and outcome ‚Äî ensuring transparency and reproducibility.
